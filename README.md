# moonhub

Welcome!

Moonhub™ is a project created by Moon or moon™#9999, this projects aim was to be a script hub for the roblox game Beyblade: Rebirth and will always remain only supported for that sole game. Keep in mind when using autofarm you have to set your Meteor to Y and set your Tornado to T and additionally Charge to F if you are planning to use "AutoCharge" and also set Clones/Hiding in the shadows to R when using LagServer and additionally you also have to use the "True Spirit" so that Moonhub™ can function properly. And also thank you for using moonhub during the early development phases and not completely polished so feedback would be much appreciated, but that is the only known error(s) by me and I am still working on a fix for it ^^ - Moon
